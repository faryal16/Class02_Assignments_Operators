# Python Operators Assignment

This repository contains an overview of Python operators, categorized into seven types, with clear explanations of their usage.

## 1 Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.

### Operators:
- `+` (Addition) – Adds two numbers.
- `-` (Subtraction) – Subtracts one number from another.
- `*` (Multiplication) – Multiplies two numbers.
- `/` (Division) – Divides one number by another (returns float).
- `%` (Modulus) – Returns the remainder of division.
- `**` (Exponentiation) – Raises a number to the power of another.
- `//` (Floor Division) – Performs division and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

## 2 Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables and modify them directly.

### Operators:
- `=` (Assign) – Assigns a value to a variable.
- `+=` (Add and Assign) – Adds a value and assigns the result.
- `-=` (Subtract and Assign) – Subtracts a value and assigns the result.
- `*=` (Multiply and Assign) – Multiplies and assigns the result.
- `/=` (Divide and Assign) – Divides and assigns the result.
- `%=` (Modulus and Assign) – Finds remainder and assigns.
- `**=` (Exponentiate and Assign) – Raises to power and assigns.
- `//=` (Floor Divide and Assign) – Floor divides and assigns.

## 3 Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and return `True` or `False`.

### Operators:
- `==` (Equal to) – Checks if values are equal.
- `!=` (Not equal to) – Checks if values are not equal.
- `>` (Greater than) – Checks if one value is greater.
- `<` (Less than) – Checks if one value is smaller.
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to) – Checks if one value is greater or equal.
- `<=` (Less than or equal to) – Checks if one value is smaller or equal.

## 4 Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

### Operators:
- `and` – Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.
- `or` – Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.
- `not` – Reverses the boolean result (`True` becomes `False`, and vice versa).

## 5⃣Identity Operators
Identity operators check whether two variables reference the same object in memory.

### Operators:
- `is` – Returns `True` if both variables refer to the same object.
- `is not` – Returns `True` if variables refer to different objects.

## 6 Membership Operators
Membership operators check whether a value exists in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).

### Operators:
- `in` – Returns `True` if the value is found in the sequence.
- `not in` – Returns `True` if the value is NOT found in the sequence.

## 7 Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators work at the binary (bit-level) to perform operations.

### Operators:
- `&` (Bitwise AND) – Compares each bit and returns `1` if both bits are `1`.
- `|` (Bitwise OR) – Compares each bit and returns `1` if at least one bit is `1`.
- `^` (Bitwise XOR) – Compares bits and returns `1` if they are different.
- `~` (Bitwise NOT) – Inverts all the bits.
- `<<` (Left Shift) – Shifts bits left by a certain number of places.
- `>>` (Right Shift) – Shifts bits right by a certain number of places.

## How to Use This Repository
- Each Python script contains examples of one type of operator.
- Run the scripts to understand how each operator functions.
- Modify values to experiment with different outputs.
